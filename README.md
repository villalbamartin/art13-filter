# Art13 v0.1
A content filter designed for Art. 13 of the EU copyright reform law.

Article 13 of the EU copyright reform law will soon force internet platforms to implement automated
content filters that ensure that no copyright infringing material is uploaded to your online
platform.

This project implements an Art.13-compliant filter. It blocks everything by default, ensuring that
no infringement will take place in your platform.

## Roadmap
 * v0.2: get the server to actually run (it currently doesn't).
 * v0.3: get the server to actually check the content of the file before rejecting it.
 * v0.4: add two whitelists, one for works that anyone can upload, and a second one for works
   that only a specific copyright holder can upload.
 * v1.0: expand documentation, improve test coverage, and remove dead code.
 * v1.1: improve performance.
