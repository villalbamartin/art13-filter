# Art13
A content filter designed for Art. 13 of the EU copyright reform law.

Article 13 of the EU copyright reform law will soon force internet platforms to implement automated
content filters that ensure that no copyright infringing material is uploaded to your online
platform.

This project implements an Art.13-compliant filter. It blocks everything by default, ensuring that
no infringement will take place in your platform. The project also includes two whitelists, one for
works that anyone can upload, and a second one for works that a specific user can use.
